// Array.shift() | The array method shift removes the first element from an array and returns that element. The length of the array is reduced by 1.

// Array.push() | The method push adds a new element to an array. The new element is passed as a parameter and is added to the end of the array.

// Write a function rotate that rotates the elements of an array. All elements should be moved one position to the left. The 0th element should be placed at the end of the array. The rotated array should be returned.

///////////

// Array.join() | Write a function list that takes an array of words and returns a string by concatenating the words in the array, separated by commas and - the last word - by an 'and'. An empty array should return an empty string.

// Array.slice() | With slice you can copy a subarray from an array. The first parameter specifies the start index (included) and the second parameter specifies the end index (excluded).

// if..else | Write a function that adds two amounts with surcharge. For each amount less than or equal to 10, the surcharge is 1. For each amount greater than 10, the surcharge is 2.

// Write a function that takes an array and an arbitrary variable. The variable should be inserted as the first element in the array.

//Array.length | Write a function that takes an array and returns the last element of the array.

function getLastElement(arr) {
  let last = arr.length - 1;
  return arr[last];
}

// Array.indexOf() | The indexOf method returns the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present. Counting starts with 0.

// Write a function that adds an element to the end of an array. However, the element should only be added if it is not already in the array.

function add(arr, x) {
  if (arr.indexOf(x) === -1) {
    arr.push(x);

// Array.concat() | Using the concat method you can concatenate two arrays.

// Write a function that concatenate two arrays. The longer array should be appended to the shorter array. If both arrays are equally long, the second array should be appended to the first array.

function concatUp(a1, a2) {
  if (a2.length >= a1.length) {
    return a1.concat(a2);

/////////

// Reduce | Write a function sum that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers.
// Write a function mean that takes an array of numbers and returns the average of these numbers. The mean function should use the sum function.

function sum(arr) {
  let resultsum = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  return resultsum;
}

function mean(arr) {
  return sum(arr) / arr.length;

// SPARSE ARRAY | A sparse array is an array of data in which many elements have a value of zero (ex. array of separate words/strings). Normally, the length property of an array specifies the number of elements in the array. If the array is sparse, the value of the length property is greater than the number of elements.

// There is a collection of N strings ( There can be multiple occurences of a particular string ). Each stringâ€™s length is no more than 20 characters. There are also Q queries. For each query, you are given a string, and you need to find out how many times this string occurs in the given collection of Q strings.
